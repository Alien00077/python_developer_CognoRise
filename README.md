## Project Overview

The repository includes the following CognoRise-projects:

1. **Calculator App**: A simple calculator for performing basic arithmetic operations.
2. **Countdown Timer**: A script that counts down from a specified time in seconds.
3. **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**: A classic game where the user plays against the computer.

Each project provides a unique functionality and is implemented in an easy-to-understand, beginner-friendly format.

## Project Details

### 1. Calculator App
- **File**: `calculator_app.py`
- **Description**: This calculator app performs basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It takes user input for two numbers and an operation, and outputs the result.
- **Features**:
  - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
  - User-friendly input prompts.
  - Error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero.

### 2. Countdown Timer
- **File**: `countdown_timer.py`
- **Description**: The countdown timer allows the user to set a time (in seconds) and counts down to zero. It's a handy script that can be used as a basic timer or integrated into other applications needing countdown functionality.
- **Features**:
  - Input prompt for countdown duration.
  - Displays countdown in real-time.
  - Notifies the user when time is up.

### 3. Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
- **File**: `Game (Rock,paper,scissor).py`
- **Description**: This script recreates the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The user makes a choice, and the computer randomly selects an option. The game then determines the winner based on traditional rules.
- **Features**:
  - User vs. Computer gameplay.
  - Random selection for computer choice.
  - Displays the result of each round (win, lose, or draw).
  - Encourages replayability.

## Getting Started

To get started with these mini-projects, you can clone the repository and run each script directly in your terminal or preferred Python environment.

### Cloning the Repository

1. Clone the repository using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-mini-projects.git
    cd python-mini-projects
    ```

2. Navigate to the folder containing the desired script.

### Running Each Script

To run each of these projects, execute the corresponding Python file from the terminal or your code editor:

- **Calculator App**:
    ```bash
    python calculator_app.py
    ```
- **Countdown Timer**:
    ```bash
    python countdown_timer.py
    ```
- **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**:
    ```bash
    python "Game (Rock,paper,scissor).py"
    ```

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: These scripts require Python 3 to run. You can download the latest version of Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **No additional libraries**: Each script only uses Pythonâ€™s standard library, so no external dependencies are needed.
